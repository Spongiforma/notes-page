      <description>Why add acid to water? A large amount of heat is released when acids dissolve in water. Addition of water to acid results in a thin layer of water on top of the acid. Heat generated in this thin layer of water can cause the water to heat up significantly and even boil, splattering acid everywhere
Exothermic reaction Amount of energy released is greater than amount of energy absorbed. As a result, the temperatures of the surroundings will increase and the reaction mixture will feel warm.</description>
