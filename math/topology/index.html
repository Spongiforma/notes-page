<h3 id="relations">Relations</h3>
<h4 id="equivalence-relations">Equivalence relations</h4>
<p>If there is a equivalence relation C on A it has the following properties,</p>
<ol>
<li>Reflexivity: xCx for every x in A.</li>
<li>Symmetry: if xCy, then yCx.</li>
<li>Transitivity: if xCy and yCz, then xCz.</li>
</ol>
<p>A <strong>equivalence class</strong> determined by x is given by:</p>
<p>\[
E = \{y \vert y \sim x\}
\]</p>
<p><strong>Lemma</strong>: Two equivalence classes E and E' are either disjoint or equal.</p>
<p><strong>Partition</strong>: Collection of disjoint nonempty subsets of A whose union is all of A.</p>
<p>Note that given any partition of A, there is exactly one equivalence relation from which it is derived.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong>: Define two points in the plane to be equivalent is they lie at the same distance from the origin. Then it is a equivalence relation and the collection of equivalence classes consists of all circles centered at the origin, along with the origin alone.</p>
<h4 id="order-relation">Order relation</h4>
<ol>
<li>(Comparability) For every x and y in A for which x != y, either xCy or yCx.</li>
<li>(Nonreflexivity) For no x in A does the relation xCx hold.</li>
<li>(Transitivity) If xCy and yCz, then xCz.</li>
</ol>
<p>(a,b) is then the set {x | a &lt; x &lt; b}, which is an open interval. If the set is empty, a (b) is the immediate predecessor (sucessor) of b (a).</p>
<p><strong>Order type</strong>: A and B have the same order type if there is a bijective correspondence between them that preserves order.</p>
<p><strong>Dictionary order</strong>: A &ldquo;lexicographic&rdquo; order relation for cartesian products.</p>
<p><strong>Least upper bound property</strong>: An ordered set A has the lub property if every nonempty subset A_0 of A that is bounded above has a least upper bound. The greatest lowerbound property is defined similarly.</p>
<h4 id="size-of-set">Size of set</h4>
<ol>
<li>A is finite if \(A \sim J_n\) for some n, where \(J_n\) is the set whose elements are the integers 1 to n.</li>
<li>A is infinite if A is not finite/ A is equivalent to one of its proper subsets.</li>
<li>A is countable if \(A \sim J\)</li>
<li>A is uncountable if A is neither finite nor countable</li>
<li>A is at most countable if A is finite or countable</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Corollaries</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Set of all integers is countable</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Proof</strong>: The set of all integers is countable as we can set up a 1-1 correspondence: \(f(n) = n/2\) when n is even, and \(f(n) = - (n-1)/2\) when n is odd.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Every infinite subset of a countable set A is countable</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The union of a sequence of countable sets is countable: Cantor diagonalisation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If \(A\) is a countable set, and \(B_n\) is the set of all n-tuples \((a_1,\ldots,a_n)\), where \(a_k \in A (k = 1,\ldots,n)\) and the elements \(a_1, \ldots, a_n\) need not be distinct. Then \(B_n\) is countable</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Theorem</strong></p>
<p>The set of all sequences whose elements are the digits 0 and 1 is uncountable.</p>
<h3 id="metric-spaces">Metric Spaces</h3>
<p>A set X, whose elements we shall call points, is said to be a metric space if any two points p,q of X there is associated a real number d(p,q), such that</p>
<ol>
<li>\(d(p,q) &gt; 0\), if \(p \neq q\); \(d(p,p) = 0\);</li>
<li>\(d(p,q) = d(q,p)\)</li>
<li>\(d(p,q) \leq d(p,r) + d(r,q)\) for any \(r \in X\)</li>
</ol>
<p>Any function with these properties is called a <strong>distance function</strong> or <strong>metric</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Definition</strong></p>
<p>If  \(a_i &lt; b_i\) for all i, then the set of points in euclidean space that satisfies the inequality \(a_i \leq x_i \leq b_i\) for all i is called a <strong>k-cell</strong>.</p>
<p>If \(x \in R^k\) and \(r &gt; 0\), the <strong>open</strong> or <strong>closed ball</strong> B, with center at x and radius r is defined to be the set of all \(y \in R^k\) such that \(\vert y - x \vert &lt; r\) or likewise for closed balls.</p>
<p>A set \(E \subset R^k\) is <strong>convex</strong> if \(\lambda \bm{x} + (1-\lambda)\bm{y} \in E\), where \(\bm{x},\bm{y} \in E\) and \(0 &lt; \lambda &lt; 1\).</p>
<p><strong>Definition</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>A <strong>neighbourhood</strong> of p is a set \(N_r(p)\) consisting of all q such that \(d(p,q) &lt; r\), for some \(r &gt; 0\). r is the <strong>radius</strong> of \(N_r(p)\).</li>
<li>A point p is a <strong>limit point</strong> of the set E if <em>every</em> neighbourhood of p contains a point \(q \neq p\) such that \(q \in E\).</li>
<li>If \(p \in E\) and p is not a limit point of E, then p is called an <strong>isolated point</strong> of E.</li>
<li>E is <strong>closed</strong> if every limit point of E is a point of E.</li>
<li>A point p is an <strong>interior</strong> point of E if there is a neighbourhood N of p such that \(N \subset E\).</li>
<li>E is <strong>open</strong> if every point of E is an interior point of E.</li>
<li>The <strong>complement</strong> of E (denoted by \(E^c\)) is the set of all points \(p \in X\) such that \(p \notin E\)</li>
<li>E is <strong>perfect</strong> if E is closed and every point of E is a limit point of E. i.e. a point is a limit point of E iff \(p \in E\).</li>
<li>E is <strong>bounded</strong> if there is a real number M and a point \(q \in X\) such that \(d(p,q) &lt; M \forall p \in E\).</li>
<li>E is <strong>dense</strong> in X if every point of X is a limit point of E, or a point of E or both.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Theorem</strong></p>
<p>Every neighbourhood is an open set.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem</strong></p>
<p>If p is a limit point of a set E, then every neighbourhood of p contains infinitely many point of E.</p>

<p><strong>Theorem</strong></p>
<p>Let \(\left{E_\alpha \right}\) be a collection of sets. Then</p>
<p>\[
\left(\bigcup_\alpha E_\alpha \right)^c = \bigcap_\alpha (E_\alpha^c)
\]</p>
<p><strong>Theorem</strong></p>
<p>A set is open iff its complement is closed</p>
<p>A set F is closed iff its complement is open.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>For any collection of open sets, \(\{G_\alpha\}\), \(\cup_\alpha G_\alpha\) is open.</li>
<li>For any collection of closed sets, \(\{F_\alpha\}\), \(\cap_\alpha G_\alpha\) is closed.</li>
<li>For any finite collection of open sets, \(\cap_i G_i\) is open.</li>
<li>For any finite collection of closed sets, \(\cup_i F_i\) is closed.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Definition</strong></p>
<p>If X is a metric space, E is a subset of X and if E' is the set of limit points of E in X, then the <strong>closure</strong> of E is the set \(\bar{E} = E \cup E'\).
in
<strong>Theorem</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>\(\bar{E}\) is closed.</li>
<li>\(E = \bar{E}\) iff E is closed.</li>
<li>\(\bar{E} \subset F\) for every closed set \(F \subset X\) such that \(E \subset F\).</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Theorem</strong>
Let E be a nonempty set of real numbers which is bounded above. Let \(y = \sup E\), then \(y \in \bar{E}\). Hence, \(y \in E\) if E is closed.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem</strong></p>
<p>Suppose \(Y \subset X\). A subset E of Y is open relative to Y iff \(E = Y \cap G\) for some open subset G of X.</p>
<p>(???)</p>
<h3 id="compact-sets">Compact sets</h3>
<p><strong>Definition</strong></p>
<p>An <strong>open cover</strong> of a set E in a metric space X, we mean a collection of open subsets of X such that \(E \subset \cup_\alpha G_\alpha\).</p>
<p><strong>Definition</strong></p>
<p>A subset K of of a metric space X is said to be <strong>compact</strong> if every open cover of K contains a subcover. i.e. if \(\left\{G_\alpha \right\}\) is an open cover of K, then there are finitely many indices \(\alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_n\), such that:</p>
<p>\[
K \subset G_{\alpha_1} \cup \ldots \cup G_{\alpha_n}
\]</p>
<p><strong>Theorem</strong></p>
<p>Suppose \(K \subset Y \subset X\). Then K is compact relative to X iff K is compact relative to Y.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem</strong></p>
<p>Compact subsets of metric spaces are closed.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem</strong></p>
<p>Closed subsets of compact sets are compact.
<strong>Corollary</strong>: If F is closed and K is compact, then \(F \cap K\) is compact.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem</strong></p>
<p>If \(\{K_\alpha\}\) is a collection of compact subsets of a metric space X such that the intersection of every finite subcollection of \(\{\K_alpha\}\) is non-empty, then \(\cap K_\alpha\) is nonempty.
<strong>Corollary</strong>: If \(\{K_n\}\) is a sequence of nonempty compact sets such that \(K_n \supset K_{n+1}\) then \(\cap_1^\infty K_n\) is not empty.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem</strong>
If E is an infinite subset of a compact set K, then E has a limit point in K.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem</strong>
If \(\{I_n\}\) is a sequence of intervals in \(R^1\), such that \(I_n \supset I_{n+1}\) then \(\cap^\infty_1 I_n\) is not empty.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem</strong>
If \(\{I_n\}\) is sequence of k-cells such that \(I_n \superset I_{n+1}\), then \(\cap^\infty_1 I_n\) is not empty.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem</strong>
Every k-cell is compact.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem</strong>
If a set in \(R^k\) has one of the following three properties, it has the other two.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>E is closed and bounded</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>E is compact</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Every infinite subset of E has a limit point in E.</p>
<p>(b) and (c) are equivalent in any metric space but (a) does not in general imply (b) and (c).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Theorem (Weierstrass)</strong></p>
<p>Every bounded infinite subset of \(R^k\) has a limit point in \(R^k\).</p>
<h3 id="perfect-sets">Perfect sets</h3>
<p><strong>Theorem</strong></p>
<p>A nonempty perfect set in \(R^k\) is uncountable.</p>
<h3 id="connected-sets">Connected sets</h3>
<p>Two subsets A,B of a metric space X are <em>seperated</em> if \(A \cap \bar{B}\) and \(\bar{A}\cap B\) are empty. A subset of X is connected if it is not a union of two nonempty seperated sets.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem</strong></p>
<p>A subset E of the real line \(R^1\) is connected iff it has the following property: If \(x,y \in E\), \(x &lt; z &lt; y\), then \(z \in E\).</p>
<h2 id="topological-spaces">Topological spaces</h2>
<p><strong>Definition</strong></p>
<p>A topology on a set X is a collection \(\mathcal{T}\) of subsets of X having the following properties.</p>
<ol>
<li>\(\emptyset\) and X are in \(\mathcal{T}\)</li>
<li>The union of the elements of any subcollection of \(\mathcal{T}\) is in \(\mathcal{T}\)</li>
<li>The intersection of the elements of any finite subcollection of \(\mathcal{T}\) is in \(\mathcal{T}\)</li>
</ol>
<p>If X is a topological space with topology \(\mathcal{T}\), we say that a subset U of X is an <strong>open set</strong> of X if U belongs to the collection \(\mathcal{T}\).</p>
<p>The collection of all subsets of X is called the <strong>discrete topology</strong>. The collection consisting of X and \(\emptyset\) only is the <strong>indiscrete/trivial topology</strong>.</p>
<p>Let \(\mathcal{T}_f\) be the collection of all subsets U of X such that X-U either is at most countable or is all of X. Then \(\mathcal{T}_f\) is the <strong>finite complement topology</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Definition</strong></p>
<p>Suppose that \(\mathcal{T}\) and \(\mathcal{T}'\) are two topologies. If \(\mathcal{T}' \supset \mathcal{T}\), we say \(\mathcal{T}'\) is <strong>finer</strong> than \(\mathcal{T}\). If it proper contains \(\mathcal{T}\), we say strictly finer than \(\mathcal{T}\). The reverse is called coarser. \(\mathcal{T}\) is comparable with \(\mathcal{T}'\) if one is the subset of the other.</p>
<h3 id="basis">Basis</h3>
<p>A <strong>basis</strong> for a topology on X is a collection \(\mathcal{B}\) of subsets of X (called <strong>basis elements</strong>) such that:</p>
<ol>
<li>For each \(x \in X\), there is at least one basis element B containing x. (B is a cover)</li>
<li>If x belongs to the intersection of two basis elements \(B_1\) and \(B_2\), then there is a basis element \(B_3\) containing x such that  \(B_3 \subset B_1 \cap B_2\).</li>
</ol>
<p>If \(\mathcal{B}\) satisfies these conditions, we define the topology generated by \(\mathcal{B}\) as: A subset U of X is said to be open in X if for each \(x \in U\), there is a basis element \(B \in \mathcal{B}\) such that \(x \in B\) and \(B \subset U\). Note each element is an element of \(\mathcal{T}\).</p>
<p><strong>Lemma</strong></p>
<p>\(\mathcal{T}\) equals the collection of all unions of elements of \(\mathcal{B}\).</p>
<p><strong>Lemma</strong></p>
<p>Let X be a topological space. Suppose that \(\mathcal{C}\) is a collection of open sets of X such that for each open set U of X and each x in U, there is an element \(C\) of \(\mathcal{C}\) such that \(x \in C \subset U\). Then \(\mathcal{C}\) is a basis for the topology of X. (C make up a cover and open set of X is a superset of some C).</p>
<p><em>Proof.</em> We will show why every element in \(\mathcal{T}\) belongs in the topology generated by the basis, \(\mathcal{T}'\). Since for \(x \in C \subset U\), there exists a union of C which equals U. The converse follows from the previous lemma.</p>
<p><strong>Lemma (Fineness)</strong></p>
<p>Let \(\mathcal{B}\) and \(\mathcal{B}'\) be the bases for topologies \(\mathcal{T}\) and \(\mathcal{T}'\) respectively on X. Then the following are equivalent.</p>
<ol>
<li>\(\mathcal{T}'\) is finer than \(\mathcal{T}\)</li>
<li>For each \(x \in X\), and each basis element \(B \in \mathcal{B}\) containing \(x\), there is a basis element \(B' \in \mathcal{B}'\) s.t. \(x \in B' \subset B\).</li>

<p><strong>Lemma</strong>

<h4 id="subbasis">Subbasis</h4>
<p>What if you extend the basis to also take finite intersections?</p>
<p><strong>Definition</strong></p>
<p>A subbasis \(\mathcal{S}\) for a topology on X is a collection of subsets of \(X\) whose union equals X. The topology generated by the subbasis is defined to be the collection \(\mathcal{T}\) of all unions of finite intersections of elements of \(\mathcal{S}\).</p>
<h3 id="order-topology">Order topology</h3>
<p><strong>Definition</strong></p>
<p>Let \(X\) be a set with a simple order relation. The collection of all sets of the following types:</p>
<ol>
<li>All open intervals</li>
<li>All intervals of the form \([a_0,b]\) where \(a_0\) is the smallest element if any</li>
<li>All intervals of the form \([a,b_0]\) where \(b_0\) is the largest element if any</li>
</ol>
<p>is the basis for the <strong>order topology</strong> on X.</p>
<h3 id="product-topology">Product topology</h3>
<p><strong>Definition</strong></p>
<p>Let X and Y be topological spaces. The <strong>product topology</strong> on \(X \times Y\) is the topology having as basis the collection of all sets of the form \(U \times V\), where \(U \in X, V \in Y\).</p>
<p><strong>Theorem</strong></p>
<p>If \(\mathcal{B}\) is the basis for the topology of \(X\) and \(\mathcal{C}\) is a basis topology of Y, then the collection:</p>
<p>\[
\mathcal{D} = \{B \times C \vert B \in \mathcal{B}, C \in \mathcal{C}\}
\]</p>
<p>is a basis for the topology of \(X \times Y\).</p>
<p>We are also interested in a subbasis.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem</strong></p>
<p>\[
\mathcal{S} = \{\pi_1^{-1}(U) \vert U \text{ open in } X \} \cup \{\pi_2^{-1}(V) \vert V \text{ open in } Y \}
\]</p>
<h3 id="subspace-topology">Subspace topology</h3>
<p><strong>Definition</strong></p>
<p>Let X be a topological space with topology \(\mathcal{T}\). If \(Y \subset X\),</p>
<p>\[
\mathcal{T}_Y = \{Y \cap U \vert U \in \mathcal{T}\}
\]</p>
<p>is the <strong>subspace topology</strong> on \(Y\). Y is then a <strong>subspace</strong> of X,</p>
<p><strong>Lemma</strong></p>
<p>A basis can be derived in a similar form. (replace Y with B).</p>
<p><strong>Lemma</strong></p>
<p>If \(U\) is open in \(Y\) and \(Y\) is open in \(X\), then \(U\) is open in \(X\).</p>
<p><strong>Definition</strong></p>
<p>A subset Y of X is convex in X if for each pair of points \(a &lt; b\) of Y, the entire interval of points of X lies in Y.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem</strong></p>
<p>Let \(X\) be an ordered set in the order topology, let Y be a subset of X that is convex in X. Then the order topology on Y, is the same as the topology Y inherits as a subspace of X.</p>
<h3 id="closed-sets">Closed sets</h3>
<p>Defining topological space with closed sets.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem</strong></p>
<p>In a topological space,</p>
<ol>
<li>the empty set and the whole set are closed</li>
<li>Arbitrary intersections of closed sets are closed</li>
<li>Finite unions of closed sets are closed</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="closures">Closures</h4>
<p><strong>Theorem</strong></p>
<p>Let A be a subset of the topological space X.</p>
<ol>
<li>Then \(x \in \bar{A}\) iff every neighbourhood of x intersects A.</li>
<li>If X is given by a basis, \(x \in \bar{A}\) iff every basis element containing x intersects A.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="hausdorff-spaces">Hausdorff spaces</h3>
<p>Usually it is nicer to have one-point sets closed like in euclidean space, as this means that sequences don&rsquo;t converge to multiple values for instance.</p>
<p><strong>Definition</strong></p>
<p>A topological space X is a <strong>Hausdorff space</strong>, if for each pair of distinct points in X, there exist neighborhoods of each point that are disjoint.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem</strong></p>
<p>Every finite point set in a hausdorff space is closed.</p>
<p>The Hausdorff space condition is stronger than the condition that finite point sets be closed (\(T_1\) axiom) but that&rsquo;s fine. But for fun:</p>
<p><strong>Theorem</strong></p>
<p>Let X be a space satisfying the \(T_1\) axiom. Let A be a subset of X, then the point x is a limit point of A iff every neighbourhood of x contains infinitely many points of A.</p>
<p>Back to hausdorff spaces:</p>
<p><strong>Theorem</strong></p>
<p>Every simply ordered set is a Hausdorff space in the order topology. Product and subspaces of hausdorff spaces are hausdorff spaces.</p>
<h3 id="continuous-functions">Continuous functions</h3>
<p><strong>Definition</strong></p>
<p>A function \(f : X \to Y\) is continuous if for each open subset V of Y, the set \(f^{-1}(V)\) is an open subset of X.</p>
<p>It also suffices to show that the inverse image of each basis/subbasis element is open.</p>
<p>Other definitions:</p>
<p><strong>Theorem</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>For every subset of X, one has \(f(\bar{A}) \subset \bar{f}(A)\).</li>
<li>For every closed set of B of Y, the set \(f^{-1}(B)\) is closed in X.</li>
<li>For every \(x \in X\) and each neighbourhood \(V\) of f(x), there is a neighbourhood \(U\) of x such that \(f(U) \subset V\).</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Definition</strong></p>
<p>If \(f\) is an injective continuous map, and f' is the surjective function by restricting the range of f, f is a topological imbedding if f' is a homeomorphism of X with Z.</p>
<h4 id="homeomorphisms">Homeomorphisms</h4>
<p>Let \(f : X \to Y\) be a bijection. If both \(f\) and its inverse function are continuous, \(f\) is called a homeomorphism.
Another way to define it is to say it is a bijective correspondence such that \(f(U)\) is open iff U is open.</p>
<h3 id="metric-topology">Metric topology</h3>
<p><strong>Definition</strong></p>
<p>The collection of all $ε$-balls \(B_d(x,\epsilon)\) is a basis for a topology on X, called the <strong>metric topology</strong>, induced by d.</p>
<p><strong>Definition (alt)</strong></p>
<p>A set U is open in the metric topology induced by d iff for each \(y \in U\), there is a \(\delta &gt; 0\) s.t. \(B_d(y,\delta) \subset U\).</p>
<p><strong>Definition</strong></p>
<p>A topological space X is <strong>metrizable</strong> if there exists a metric on X that induces the topology of X. A <strong>metric space</strong> is a metrizable space together with a specific metric that gives the topology of X.</p>
<p><strong>Lemma (Sequence lemma)</strong></p>
<p>Let \(X\) be a topological space. Let \(A \subset X\). If there is sequence of points of \(A\) converging to \(x\), then \(x \in \bar{A}\). the converse holds if \(X\) is metrizable.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem</strong></p>
<p>Let \(f : X \to Y\). If the fucntion if is continuous, then for every convergent sequence \(x_n \to x\) in X, the sequence \(f(x_n)\) converges to \(f(x)\). The converse holds if \(X\) is metrizable.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem (Uniform limit theorem)</strong></p>
<p>Let \(f_n : X \to Y\) be a sequence of continuous functions from the topological space \(X\) to the metric space \(Y\). If \((f_n)\) converges uniformly to \(f\), then \(f\) is continuous.</p>
<h3 id="quotient-topology">Quotient topology</h3>
<p><strong>Definition</strong></p>
<p>Let X and Y be topological spaces; let \(p : X \to Y\) be a surjective map. The map \(p\) is said to be a quotient map provided a subset \(U\) of \(Y\) is open in Y if and only if \(p^{-1}(U)\) is open in X.</p>
<p>(like a homeomorphism without being injective)</p>
<p><strong>Definition</strong></p>
<p>A subset \(C\) of \(X\) is saturated (with respect to the surjective map) if \(C\) contains every set \(p^{-1}({y})\) it intersects. Thus \(C\) is saturated if it equals the complete inverse image of a subset of \(Y\). To say that \(P\) is a quotient map is equivalent to saying that \(p\) is continuous and \(p\) maps saturated open sets of \(X\) of to open sets of \(Y\).</p>
<p>A map is an open set if for each open set in its domain, its image is also open, and likewise for closed maps. All open/closed maps are quotient maps.</p>
<p><strong>Definition</strong></p>
<p>If X is a space and A is a set and if \(p:X\to A\) is a surjective map, there is exactly one topology \(\mathcal{T}\) on A relative to which p is a quotient map, which is the <strong>quotient topology</strong> induced by p.</p>
<p><strong>Definition</strong></p>
<p>Let \(X\) be a topological space, and let \(X^*\) be a partition of \(X\) into disjoint subsets whose union is \(X\). Let \(p : X \to X^*\) be the surjective map that carries each point of \(X\) to the element of \(X^*\) containing it. In the quotient topology induced by \(p\), the space \(X^*\) is called a <strong>quotient space</strong> of X.</p>
<p>What concepts do quotient maps work well with?</p>
<h4 id="subspaces">Subspaces</h4>
<p><strong>Theorem</strong></p>
<p>Let \(p : X \to Y\) be a quotient map; let A be a subspace of X that is saturated with respect to p.; let \(q: A \to p(A)\) be the map obtained by restricting p.</p>
<ol>
<li>If A is either open or closed in X, then q is a quotient map</li>
<li>If p is either an open map or a closed map, then q is a quotient map.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="composites">Composites</h4>
<p>Composites of quotient maps are quotient maps.</p>
<h4 id="products">Products</h4>
<p>Products of maps do not behave well, and one needs conditions such as local compactness, and that the two maps are open maps.</p>
<h4 id="hausdorff-condition">Hausdorff condition</h4>
<p>Does not behave well.</p>
<p>For \(X^*\) to satisfy the \(T_1\) axiom, one requires that each eleemtn of the partition \(X^*\) be a closed subset of \(X\).</p>
<h4 id="continuous-functions">Continuous functions</h4>
<p>Similar to how we had a criterion for determining when a map into a product space was continuous, we wish to find when a map out of a quotient space is continuous.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem</strong></p>
<p>Let \(p:X\to Y\) be a quotient map. Let \(Z\) be a space and let \(g : X \to Z\) be a map that is constant on each set \(p^{-1}({y})\) for \(y \in Y\). Then \(g\) induces a map \(f : Y \to Z\) such that \(f \circ p = g\). The induced map \(f\) is continuous iff g is continuous; f is a quotient map iff g is a quotient map.</p>
<p><strong>Corollary</strong></p>
<p>Let \(g : X \to Z\) be a surjective continuous map. Let \(X*\) be the following collection of subsets of \(X\):</p>
<p>\[
X^* = \{g^{-1}(\{z\}) \vert z \in Z\}
\]</p>
<p>Give it the quotient topology.</p>
<ol>
<li>The map g induces a bijective continuous map f, which is a homeomorphism iff g is a quotient map</li>
<li>If \(Z\) is Hausdorff, so is \(X^*\).kk</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="topological-groups">Topological Groups</h4>
<p>A <strong>topological group</strong> G is a geoup that is also a topological space satisfying the \(T_1\) axiom, such that the map of \(G \times G\) into \(G\) sending \(x x y\) into \(x \dot y\) and the map of G into G sending x into 1/x are continuous maps.</p>
<h2 id="connectedness-and-compactness">Connectedness and compactness</h2>
<h3 id="connected-spaces">Connected spaces</h3>
<p><strong>Definition</strong></p>
<p>Let \(X\) be a topological space. A <strong>seperation</strong> of X is a pair of disjoint nonempty open subsets of X whose union is X. The space is <strong>connected</strong> if there does not exist a seperation of X.</p>
<p>Note that connectedness is a topological property.</p>
<p>Another formulation of connectedness is that a space is connected iff the only subsets that are both open and closed in X are the empty set and X itself.</p>
<p>For a subspace of a topological space, there is another useful formulation.</p>
<p><strong>Lemma</strong></p>
<p>If Y is a subspace of X, a seperation of Y is a pair of disjoint nonempty sets A and B whose union is Y. neither of which contains a limit point of the other. The space Y is connected if there exists no seperation of Y.</p>
<h4 id="forming-connected-spaces-from-given-ones">Forming connected spaces from given ones</h4>
<p><strong>Lemma</strong></p>
<p>If the sets C and D form a seperation of X, and if Y is a connected subspace of X, then Y lies entirely within either C or D.</p>
<p><strong>Properties:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>The union of a collection of connected subspaces of X that have a point in common is connected.</li>
<li>Let A be a connected subspace of X. If \(A \subset B \subset \bar{A}\), then B is also connected.</li>
<li>The image of a connected space under a continuous map is connected.</li>
<li>A finite cartesian product of connected spaces is connected.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="connected-subspaces-of-the-real-line">Connected subspaces of the real line</h3>
<p>A simply ordered set L having more than one element is called a <strong>linear continuum</strong> if the following hold:</p>
<ol>
<li>L has the least upper bound property</li>
<li>If \(x &lt; y\), there exists \(z\) such that \(x &lt; z &lt; y\)</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Theorem</strong></p>
<p>If L is a linear continuum in the order topology, then L is connected, and so are intervals and rays in L.</p>
<p><strong>Corollary</strong></p>
<p>The real line is connected and so are intervals and rays</p>
<p><strong>Theorem (Intermediate value theorem)</strong></p>
<p>Let \(f : X \to Y\) be a continuous map, where X is a connected space and Y is an ordered set in the order topology. If a and b are two points of X and if r is a point of Y lying between f(a) and f(b), then there exists a point c of X such that f(c) = r.</p>
<h3 id="path-connectedness">Path connectedness</h3>
<p><strong>Definition</strong></p>
<p>Given points x and y of the space X, a <strong>path</strong> in X from x to y is a continuous map \(f : [a,b] \to X\) of some closed interval in the real line into X, such that f(a) = x and f(b) = y. A space X is said to be path connected if every pair of points of X can be joined by a path in X.</p>
<p>Although a path-connected space is connected, the converse may not hold (Such as the ordered square).</p>
<h3 id="components-and-local-connectedness">Components and local connectedness</h3>
<p><strong>Definition</strong></p>
<p>Given X, define an equivalence relation on X by setting \(x \tilde y\) if there is a connected subspace of X containing both x and y. The equivalence classes are the components of X.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem</strong></p>
<p>The components of X are connected disjoint subspaces of X whose union is X. such that nonempty connected subspace of X intersects only one of them.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem</strong></p>
<p>the path components are defined similarly, with an equivalence relation when there is a path from x to y in X.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem</strong></p>
<p>The path components of X are path-connected disjoint subpaces of X whose union is X, such that each nonempty path-connected subspace of X intersects only one of them.</p>
<p><strong>Definition</strong></p>
<p>A space X is said to be <strong>locally connected at x</strong>, if for every neighbourhood U of x, there is a connected neighborhood V of x contained in U. If X is locally connected at each of its points, it is said simply to be locally connected. Similarly, a space is <strong>locally path connected at x</strong> if for every neighbourhood U of X, there is a path-connected neighborhood V of x contained in U.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem</strong></p>
<p>A space X is locally connected iff for every open set U of X, each component of U is open in X.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem</strong></p>
<p>A space X is locally path connected iff for every open set U of X, each path component of U is open in X.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem</strong></p>
<p>If X is a topological space, each path component of X lies in a component of X. If X is locally path connected, then the components and the path components of X are the same.</p>
<h3 id="compact-spaces">Compact spaces</h3>
<p><strong>Definition</strong></p>
<p>A space X is <strong>compact</strong> if every open covering A of X contains a finite subcollection that also covers X.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem</strong></p>
<p>Every closed subspace of a compact space is compact.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem</strong></p>
<p>Every compact subspace of a Hausdorff space is closed</p>
<p><strong>Lemma</strong></p>
<p>If Y is a compact subspace of the Hausdorff space X and \(x_0\) is not in Y, then there exist disjoint open sets U and V of X containing \(x_0\) and Y, respectively.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem</strong></p>
<p>The image of a compact space under a continuous map is compact.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem</strong></p>
<p>Let \(f : X \to Y\) is a bijective continuous function. If X is a compact and Y is Hausdorff, then f is a homeomorphism</p>
<p>Useful for proving a map is a homeomorphism.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem</strong></p>
<p>The product of finitely many compact spaces is compact.</p>
<p><strong>Lemma (The tube lemma)</strong></p>
<p>Consider the product space \(X \times Y\), where Y is compact. If N is an open set of \(X \times Y\) containing the slice \(x_0 \times Y\) of \(X \times Y\), then N contains some tube \(W \times Y\) about \(x_0 \times Y\), where \(W\) is a neighbourhood of \(x_0\) in X.</p>
<p>For infinite products, we require the Tychanoff theorem.</p>
<h4 id="finite-intersection">Finite intersection</h4>
<p>Following is another formulation of compactness.</p>
<p><strong>Definition</strong></p>
<p>A collection \(\mathcal{C}\) of subsets of X is said to have the <strong>finite intersection property</strong> if for every finite subcollection, its intersection is nonempty.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem</strong></p>
<p>Let X be a topological space. Then X is compact iff for every collection of closed sets in X having the finite intersection property, the intersection of all its elements is nonempty.</p>
<h3 id="compact-subspaces-of-the-real-line">Compact subspaces of the real line</h3>
<p><strong>Theorem</strong></p>
<p>Let X be a simply ordered set having the least upper bound property. In the order topology, each closed interval in X is compact.</p>
<p><strong>Corollary</strong></p>
<p>Every closed interval in \(\mathbb{R}\) is compact</p>
<p><strong>Theorem</strong></p>
<p>A subspace A of \(R^n\) is compact iff it is closed and bounded in the euclidean or square metric.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem (EVT)</strong></p>
<p>Let \(f : X \to Y\) be continuous, where Y is an ordered set in the order topology. If X is compact, then there exist points c and d in X such that \(f( c) \leq f(x) \leq f(d)\) for every \(x \in X\).</p>
<h4 id="uniform-continuity-theorem">Uniform continuity theorem</h4>
<p><strong>Definition</strong></p>
<p>Let (X,d) be a metric space. let A be a nonempty subst of X. For each \(x \in X\), we define the distance from x to A by the equation:</p>
<p>\[
d(x,A) = \inf \{d(x,a) \vert a \in A\}
\]</p>
<p><strong>Lemma (The Lebesgue number lemma)</strong></p>
<p>Let \(\mathcal{A}\) be an open covering of the metric space (X,d). If X is compact, there is a \(\delta &gt; 0\) such that for each subset of X having diameter less that \(\delta\), there exists an element of \(\mathcal{A}\) containing it.</p>
<p>\(\delta\) is known as the <strong>Lebesgue number</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Definition</strong></p>
<p>A function f fomr the metric space \((X,d_X)\) to the metric space \((Y,d_Y)\) is said to be <strong>uniformly continuous</strong> if given \(\epsilon &gt; 0\), there is a \(\delta &gt; 0\) such that for every pair of points \(x_0,x_1\) of X.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem (Uniform continuity theorem)</strong></p>
<p>Let \(f : X \to Y\) be a continuous map of the compact metric space (X,dx) to the metric space (Y,dy). Then f is uniformly continuous.</p>
<h4 id="uncountability-of-real-numbers">Uncountability of real numbers</h4>
<p><strong>Definition</strong></p>
<p>A point x of a space X is said to be an <strong>isolated point</strong> of X if the one-point set \(\{x\}\) is open in X.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem</strong></p>
<p>Let X be a nonempty compact Hausdorff space. If X has no isolated points, then X is uncountable.</p>
<p><strong>Corollary</strong></p>
<p>Every closed interval in \(\mathbb{R}\) is uncountable.</p>
<h3 id="limit-point-compactness">Limit point compactness</h3>
<p>Also known as <strong>Frechet compactness</strong>, or <strong>Bolzano-Weierstrass property</strong>, and was the former definition of compactness whereas the covering formulation was called &ldquo;bicompactness&rdquo;.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem</strong></p>
<p>Compactness implies limit point compactness, but not conversely.</p>
<p><strong>Definition</strong></p>
<p>Let X be a topological space. It is <strong>sequentially compact</strong> if every sequence of points of X has a convergent subsequence.</p>
<p>But metrizable spaces are very nice so:</p>
<p><strong>Theorem</strong></p>
<p>Let \(X\) be a metrizable space. Then the three defintions of compactness are equivalent.</p>
<h3 id="local-compactness">Local compactness</h3>
<p>We wish to prove the basic theorem that any locally compact Hausdorff space can be imbedded in a certain compact Hausdorff space that is called its <strong>one-point compactification.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Definition</strong></p>
<p>A space X is said to be <strong>locally compact at x</strong> if there is some compact subspace C of X that contains a neighbourhood of x.</p>
<p>Metrizable spaces and compact Hausdorff spaces are very well behaved. A subspace of a metrizable space is also metrizable but the subspace of a compact Hausdorff space need not be compact.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem</strong></p>
<p>Let X be a space. Then X is locally compact hausdorff iff there exists a space Y satisfying the following conditions:</p>
<ol>
<li>X is a subspace of Y.</li>
<li>The set Y - X consists of a single point.</li>
<li>Y is a compact Hausdorff space.</li>
</ol>
<p>If there are two spaces satisfying these conditions, then there is a homeomorphism between them that equals the identity map on X.</p>
<p><strong>Definition</strong></p>
<p>If Y is a compact Hausdorff space and X is a proper subspace of Y whose closure equals Y, then Y is said to be a <strong>compactification</strong> of X. If Y-X equals a single point, then Y is called the <strong>one-point compactification</strong> of X.</p>
<p>But our definition of local compactness does not involve arbitrarily small neighbourhoods like the other definitions. Thus, here is a definition which is equivalent when X is Hausdorff.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem</strong></p>
<p>Let X be a Hausdorff space. Then X is locally compact iff given x in X, and given a neighborhood U of x, there is a neighbourhood V of x such that \(\bar{V}\) is compact and \(\bar{V}\subset U\).</p>
<p><strong>Corollary</strong></p>
<p>Let X be locally compact Hausdorff; Let A be a subspace of X. If A is closed/open in X, then A is locally compact.</p>
<p>If A is closed, we don&rsquo;t need the Hausdorff condition.</p>
<p><strong>Corollary</strong></p>
<p>A space X is homeomorphic to an open subspace of a compact Hausdorff space iff X is locally compact Hausdorff.</p>
<p>This follows from the previous corollary and the second last theorem.</p>
<h2 id="countability-and-seperation-axioms">Countability and Seperation axioms</h2>
<p>We wish to prove the Urysohn metrization theorem, which says that if a topological space satisfies a certain countability axiom (the second) and a certain seperation axiom (the regularity axiom), then X can be imbedded in a metric space and is thus metrizable.</p>
<p>Another imbedding theorem useful in geometry is that given a space that is a compact manifold, we show that it can be imbedded in some finite dimensional euclidean space.</p>
<h3 id="countability-axioms">Countability Axioms</h3>
<p><strong>Definition</strong></p>
<p>A space X is said to have a <strong>countable basis at x</strong> if there is a countable collection \(\mathcal{B}\) of neighbourhoods of x such that each neighbourhood of x contains at least one of the elements of \(\mathcal{B}\). A space that has a countable basis at each of its points is said to satisfy the <strong>first countability axiom</strong>, or be <strong>first-countable</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem</strong></p>
<p>Let X be a topological space.</p>
<ol>
<li>Let A be a subset of X. If there is a sequence of points A converging to x, then \(x\in \bar{A}\). The converse holds if X is first-countable.</li>
<li>Let \(f: X \to Y\). If f is continuous, then for every convergent sequence \(x_n \to x\) in X, the sequence \(\{x_n\}\) converges to \(f(x)\). The converse holds if X is first-countable.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Definition</strong></p>
<p>If a space X has a countable basis for its topology, then X is said to satisfy the <strong>second countability axiom</strong>, or to be <strong>second-countable</strong>.</p>
<p>This axiom implies the first, and is usually satisfied by familiar spaces.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem</strong></p>
<p>A subspace of a first-countable space is first-countable, and a countable product of first-countable spaces if first-countable. A subspace of a second-countable space is second-countable, and a countable product of second-countable spaces is second-countable.</p>
<p><strong>Definition</strong></p>
<p>A subset A of X is said to be <strong>dense</strong> in X if \(\bar{A} = X\).</p>
<p><strong>Theorem</strong></p>
<p>Suppose X has a countable basis. Then:</p>
<ol>
<li>Every open covering of X contains a countable subcollection covering X. (<strong>Lindelof space</strong>)</li>
<li>There exists a countable subset of X that is dense in X. (<strong>seperable</strong>)</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="seperation-axioms">Seperation axioms</h3>
<p>We will introduce seperation axioms stronger than Hausdorff.</p>
<p><strong>Definition</strong></p>
<p>Suppose that one-point sets are closed in X. Then X is said to be <strong>regular</strong> if for each pair consisting of a point x and a closed set B disjoint from X, there exist disjoint open sets containing x and B, respectively. The space X is said to be <strong>normal</strong> if for each pair A,B of disjoint closed sets of X, there exist disjoint open sets containing A and B, respectively.</p>
<p>A regualar space is Hausdorff and a normal space is regular (Though we need to include the condition that one-point sets be closed. See the two-point space in the indiscrete topology satisfies the other parts of the definitions of regularity and normality without being Hausdorff).</p>
<p><strong>Lemma</strong></p>
<p>Let X be a topological space. Let one-point sets in X be closed.</p>
<ol>
<li>X is regular iff given a point x of X and a neighbourhood U of x, there is a neighbourhood V of x such that \(\bar{V}\subset U\).</li>
<li>X is normal iff given a closed se A and an open set U containing A, there is an open set V containing A such that \(\bar{V} \subset U\).</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Theorem</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>A subspace of a Hausdorff space is Hausdorff; a product of Hausdorff spaces is Hausdorff.</li>
<li>A subspace of a regular space is regular; a product of regular spaces is regular</li>
</ol>
<p>But there is no analagous theorem for normal spaces</p>
